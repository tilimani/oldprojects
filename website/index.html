            Hello world! My name is Alex Cyphus. I am a third year Finance and Economics student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. I have always been interested in code and have played around with HTML since my grungy Tumblr days editing Tumblr templates. This summer (2017) was the inflection point that sent me from blasé about code to downright obsessed. I started learning Python through YouTube tutorials and something about it appealed to me in a way that it never had before. I spent every free hour outside of my 9-5 internship learning and writing code, irritating fellow commuters with the gigantic textbook I would put on the table between us. I would say my interest was bordering on a mental condition, with myself sacrificing sleep almost every night to finish a chapter/project/video and reading an entire Ruby on Rails textbook while on a family holiday to Belize.
          </p> <br/> <p class="paragraph text-justify">
            I designed this site as an experiment in learning CSS through hacking together a site with a little knowledge and a lot of Googling. It turned out surprisingly well but now when I close my eyes I can see the Stack Overflow logo. Additionally – do not look at the source code it is a mess. It will also be a landing site for future projects. Please feel free to peruse and follow me on my ~coding adventure~.
